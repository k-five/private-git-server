        <hr>
        <p>The best use case for this architecture is for countries e.g. <strong>Iran</strong> that have been blocked by gitlab, etc and developers in these countries have to use a VPN, or setup a proxy for git, or other dirty solutions.</p>
        <p>None of the solutions I have tired myself and have seen that others tired are the correct and the right ones.</p>
        <p>Sp I came up with this idea of having a <strong>Private Git Sever</strong> outside of a blocked country, like me, since I live in Iran.</p>
