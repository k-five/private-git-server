        <p>Here is quick review of kinds of monitoring we can have.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Web based monitoring</h3>
        <p>Using HTML5 Web Socket API we can have a real-time monitoring using our web browsers.</p>
        <p>Here is an example <a target="_blank" href="http://rtsm.ir">rtsm.ir</a>.</p>

        
        <h3 class="sub-title">Git based monitoring</h3>
        <p>Using <strong>git hooks</strong> we can have embedded monitoring as you can see in below screenshot.</p>
        <img widht="100%" src="/build/img/embedded-git-monitoring.png" alt="embedded-git-monitoring.png">

        
        <h3 class="sub-title">Phone based monitoring</h3>
        <p>If we like to receive a kind of notification on our phone, we can setup Text Message Notification.</p>
        <p>This is an asynchronous notification that unlike emailing we do not have to check our email periodically.</p>
        <p>For example using ndoe.js, or bash API like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">#!/bin/bash

# Get the API KEY from your xxxxxxxxx.com account
readonly API_KEY='our-api-key';

to="$1" 
from="$2"
text="$3" 

echo "$(date) ${text} ${from} $to" &amp;&gt;&gt; /tmp/sms.log

curl -X POST "http://api.xxxxxxxxx.com/v2/sms/send/simple" \
	-H "apikey: ${API_KEY}" \
	-H 'cache-control: no-cache' \
	-H 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
	-d "message=${text}&amp;linenumber=${from}&amp;receptor=${to}" &amp;&gt;&gt; /tmp/sms.log</code></pre>


        <h3 class="sub-title">SSH based monitoring</h3>
        <p>Using SSH and keeping the connection alive helps us to have a secure, fast, real-time, and amazing monitoring.</p>
        <p>The interesting part of using SSH is that we can redirect the output to our psuedo-terminal so we can have a single terminal for both pushing and monitoring.</p>
        <p>Here is screenshot that after pushing to the server, the result is redirected to us.</p>
        <img widht="100%" src="/build/img/ssh-monitoring.png" alt="ssh-monitoring.png">
        <ul>
            <li>I push to github</li>
            <li>github notifies jsfun.ir</li>
            <li>jsfun.ir does a merge</li>
            <li>merge result comes from server to my local machine using SSH</li>
            <li>then is redirected to the terminal I pushed from!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All happens within 2 or 3 seconds.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Third-party services for monitoring</h3>
        <p>There are also services that using their APIs we can do monitoring e.g Slack, etc</p>
