        <p>Here is quick review of kinds of monitoring we can have.</p>

        <h3 class="sub-title">Web based monitoring</h3>
        <p>Using HTML5 Web Socket API we can have a real-time monitoring using our web browsers.</p>
        <p>Here is an example <a target="_blank" href="http://rtsm.ir">rtsm.ir</a>.</p>

        
        <h3 class="sub-title">Git based monitoring</h3>
        <p>Using <strong>git hooks</strong> we can have embedded monitoring as you can see in below screenshot.</p>

        
        <h3 class="sub-title">Phone based monitoring</h3>
        <p>If we like to receive a kind of notification on our phone, we can setup Text Message Notification.</p>
        <p>This is an asynchronous notification that unlike emailing we do not have to check our email periodically.</p>


        <h3 class="sub-title">SSH based monitoring</h3>
        <p>Using SSH and keeping the connection alive help us to have a secure, fast, amazing monitoring.</p>
        <p>In interesting part of using SSH is that we can redirect the out to our psuedo-terminal so we can have a single terminal for both pushing and monitoring.</p>
        <p>Here is screenshot that after pushing to the server, the result can be redirected to us.</p>
